                   <div> <p data-translate="hero_text[0]">Mediation is a negotiation process between parties with the participation of a mediator, aimed at resolving the dispute(s) between them by developing a mutually acceptable agreement. Mediation is applicable for resolving disputes arising from civil legal relations, including those related to entrepreneurial and other business (economic) activities, and is suitable for disputes arising from labor and family legal relations. Mediation allows parties to avoid court proceedings and the public disclosure of existing issues in business, family, and labor relations.
                        This method is widely used in various fields, including education, business, family relations, and international negotiations. The main advantage of mediation lies in its ability to maintain peaceful interaction between the parties, avoiding escalation of conflicts and litigation. 
                        Mediation as a way of conflict resolution has ancient roots. Its elements can be found in the traditions of different cultures, where intermediaries helped the parties to come to an agreement. For example, in ancient societies, elders or spiritual leaders played the role of mediators, contributing to the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
                    <p data-translate="hero_text[1]">Modern mediation began to take shape in the middle of the 20th century, especially in the USA and Europe. In the 1960s and 70s, it began to actively develop as an alternative to litigation, especially in family and labor conflicts. Mediation began to develop in Russia in the 1990s, when the first conflict resolution centers were established, such as the St. Petersburg Conflict Resolution Center.
                        Mediation has developed in different ways depending on cultural traditions and historical conditions.</p></div>
